# dotfiles
These are my dotfiles, backed up with stow and uploaded to GitHub.

I've added these here mostly for my own ease of use, but feel free to copy and use them if they are useful to you.

I do not guarantee in any way that these files are free from error, or that they won't cause you issues on your own system.

Use these files at your own risk.
